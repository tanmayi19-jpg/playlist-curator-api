# 🎶 Playlist Curator — Gym, Study, and Sleep

A simple, mood-based playlist generator that uses the Deezer Search API to instantly create playlists for **Gym**, **Study**, or **Sleep**. Users can also search for any artist or song, add tracks to a saved playlist, and play 30-second previews directly in the app. All playlists are stored using `localStorage` so they stay saved even after refreshing the page.
